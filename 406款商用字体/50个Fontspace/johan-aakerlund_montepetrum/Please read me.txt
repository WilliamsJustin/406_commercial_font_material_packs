	Read me V1.0 - 26/1 - 2010


	Thank you for downloading Montepetrum!

If you like Montepetrum and use it, you are very welcome to leave a donation!
Making fonts is much work and even a very small amount of money will be highly appreciated, encouraging me to keep making fonts available free of charge.  
To make a donation, use the link "donate" included in the Montepetrum folder.

(Note that it is entirely up to you if you want to leave a donation, and not doing so should by no means morally stop you from using Montepetrum)



	To install:

Windows:
Copy the font files to C:\windows\fonts

Mac:
Put the files into /Library/Fonts (for all users), or into /Users/Your_username/Library/Fonts (for you only).

Linux:
Copy the font files to fonts:// in the File manager

I hope you will enjoy using it.

This means, that you can share the font as you like, but not make a new version of the font (e.g. an italic version) and publish it without my permission. Other than that, you are free to use it as you like in any way (mix it with other fonts/ change letters etc. etc.)

If you still have questions or comments, you can write to my email: aajohan@gmail.com
You are also very welcome to show me how you've used the font, as part of the joy creating a font lies in seeing it being used.
